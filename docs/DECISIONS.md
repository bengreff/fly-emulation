# Decision log

Short records of user decisions and major implementation choices. Newest last.

## 2026-09-14 Session 1 setup

- **Compute:** backhouse GPU (RTX 4070 Ti SUPER, WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04) may be used freely. Set up direct SSH into WSL for long jobs. Existing `/home/greff` content belongs to another project; do not modify.
- **Data access:** user has no neuPrint/Janelia or FlyWire/CAVE account yet and will register on request. Proceed with open releases first (Pugliese code/data, Azevedo Dryad, Zenodo, Caltech Data) and list exactly which registration unblocks which dataset.
- **Budget:** overnight unattended GPU jobs are acceptable. Raw data up to ~200 GB on the WSL disk. Mac keeps no raw data (56 GB free).
- **Repository:** private GitHub repo as canonical remote; checkouts on both the Mac and WSL. Raw data stays out of git.
- **Hardware correction:** README's "RTX 4070 Super" is actually a 4070 Ti SUPER with 16 GB (see ENVIRONMENT.md).
- **Router:** backhouse internet was paused at the eero router on first contact (apt/curl returned an eero "Device Paused" page). User is unpausing it; no tunneling workaround was used.
- **Reporting style:** user has little neuroscience background. Define fly-specific terms on first use; lead with milestone meaning.
- **Cadence:** run autonomously to a first measured result, then report with a run command and the next discriminating test.
- **Git identity:** Ben Greff <ben@thegreffs.com>; applied to new commits only; the first four commits keep the earlier author.
- **Reference code licensing:** Pugliese repo declares MIT in pyproject.toml but ships no LICENSE file; treat as MIT-intended, do not redistribute its bundled data until confirmed.

## 2026-09-14 Session 1, during work

- **CUDA skipped on the PC.** The workload parallelises across cores and the PC has 28.
  Measured CPU throughput there matches the Mac. Building CUDA offline would have added
  ~2.5 GB of transfers and version risk for no gain on this experiment class.
- **High synaptic-scale runs stopped early.** Scales 0.13, 0.2 and 0.3 were killed
  mid-sweep. The trend across 0.03, 0.045 and 0.09 already showed the transition to
  hyperactive and arrhythmic, those runs cost 500+ s per replicate and rising, and they
  were starving the phasic-versus-tonic experiment, which is the discriminating one.
  Rerun them if the transition point itself becomes the question.
- **Reimplemented the rate equation rather than patching the external repo.** Keeps the
  pinned upstream clone clean for provenance. The reimplementation was verified to
  reproduce the external solver path exactly at matched settings before use.
- **Glutamate sweep stopped after four of six points.** 0.03, 0.02, 0.01 and 0.0 complete
  at eight draws, which already show the monotonic collapse; the excitatory points run in a
  hyperactive regime and are very slow, and they were blocking the transmitter-uncertainty
  experiment, which is the more important one. The -0.03 row is a single draw.
- **Two sweeps at a time on the laptop, not three.** Three concurrent sweeps drove load to
  25 on ten cores and slowed everything proportionally.
- **Matched fixed-label control for the transmitter experiment dropped.** The resampled
  24 draws are compared against the existing 16-draw baseline (0.836 +/- 0.119) rather
  than a fresh 24-draw fixed-label run. The comparison is between a bimodal distribution
  and a tight one, so the extra draws would not have changed the conclusion, and the
  capacity went to the corrected-model window sweep, which was producing the more
  interesting result.
- **Proprioceptor-sign comparison and E/I balance sweep not run.** Both were queued and
  released for capacity. The sign question is already answered qualitatively by F10 and
  F12; the E/I question is largely superseded by the corrected-model sweep, which varies
  excitability rather than the excitation/inhibition ratio.
- **Bristle drive at amplitude 12.5 abandoned.** No replicate completed in 24 minutes. The
  mechanosensory bristle population carries a 12.9x gain multiplier under the model's size
  rule (F11), so driving it hard makes the network so active that the adaptive solver
  crawls. The A=5 bristle condition completed and already answers the question
  (rhythmicity 0.039). The intractability is itself a symptom of F11.

## 2026-09-14 Strategy questions, decided by me

Ben asked six framing questions before the session and then said to work from my own
judgement. These are the answers I acted on, recorded so they can be overridden.

1. **Evidence ranking: interventions first, then neural recordings, then behaviour.**
   Acted on throughout. The session spent its compute on controls and perturbations, not
   on making anything look good. The degree-matched shuffle, the drive-target control and
   the threshold-matched control are all intervention-style evidence.
2. **Specimen: the male nerve cord (MANC), by inheritance.** Chosen because the strongest
   executable precedent uses it and because its motor-neuron muscle annotations are the
   best available. Not a considered cross-specimen decision; revisit when the brain is
   needed, since the best brain data is female.
3. **Grain: rate-based, single-compartment, as published.** Kept deliberately. Nothing
   found tonight implicates the neuron model. The problems are sign, strength and
   excitability, which sit above the choice of neuron equation.
4. **Behavioural fitting: not reached, and not needed yet.** There is no behaviour to fit
   to until a leg moves. The physiology-only path has not been exhausted.
5. **End state: unchanged.** Not a live question until a leg works.
6. **Explainers: written.** The session report defines every fly-specific term on first
   use and leads with what each result means for the milestone.

The hypotheses I stated before starting, and what happened to them:

| Hypothesis | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Count-weighted synapses reproduce the rhythm under descending drive | **Confirmed** (F3), robust across 16 draws |
| That rhythm, through muscles with feedback, produces a step | **Untested.** F3 and F6 show the motor output is roughly 13x too weak and a third of it has no muscle to drive |
| Synapse count alone is insufficient; cell-type-specific gains are needed | **Supported indirectly.** F9 and F13 show the result turns on sign assignments, which is the same class of missing parameter |
| A physiology-only model predicts new interventions | **Untested** |
| Dopamine-gated plasticity produces odour learning | **Untested**, belongs to a later milestone |

The prediction I made about the workflow was that the biggest risks would fail early and
visibly on one leg. That is what happened, though not where expected: the failures were in
the model's parameter conventions rather than in the biomechanics.
